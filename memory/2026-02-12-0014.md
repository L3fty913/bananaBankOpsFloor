## Conversation Summary

assistant: The RPC connection is probably hanging. Let me kill it and try a different approach:
assistant: Let me run it from my sandbox where RPCs actually work:
assistant: The USDC is there ($95.15) and allowances are already **max approved** for CTF and NegRisk exchanges! The issue is the **third contract** (`0xd91E...`) has no allowance, and Polymarket's API cache shows $0. Let me approve the third contract and force a cache refresh:
assistant: TX was sent but took too long to confirm. Let me check if it went through and also force-update the Polymarket cache:
assistant: The approval tx is still pending — gas price might be too low. But actually, the CTF and NegRisk exchanges already have max allowance. The issue might be that Polymarket's API cache is stale. Let me force-refresh it and also restart the bot:
assistant: Interesting — Polymarket's API still says balance 0 and allowances 0, even though on-chain shows $95.15 USDC with max allowances on CTF and NegRisk. This means Polymarket is looking at a **different USDC contract** than where the funds are.

Let me check — Polymarket uses **USDC.e (bridged)** not native USDC:
assistant: That's the problem. The $95.15 is in **native USDC** but Polymarket uses **USDC.e (bridged)**. They're two different tokens on Polygon.

Found the issue, Morpheus. Your $95.15 is in **native USDC** but Polymarket uses **USDC.e (bridged)** — they're two different tokens on Polygon.

You need to swap native USDC → USDC.e. Quickest way:

1. Go to **app.uniswap.org** or **quickswap.exchange**
2. Connect with the bot wallet (or any wallet)
3. Swap **USDC → USDC.e** on Polygon
4. It's a 1:1 swap, maybe a few cents in fees

Or — if you bought on an exchange, some let you withdraw directly as USDC.e on Polygon. That'd skip the swap.

Want me to do the swap programmatically from the bot wallet? I have the private key and there's enough POL for gas. 📈

[Telegram Based Dev (@L3fty1) id:5625085943 Wed 2026-02-11 23:59 UTC] Also. I just got the poly market account secured for trading. We’ve got $110 in the phantom wallet and 88.14 in poly market wallet.

user: [Telegram Based Dev (@L3fty1) id:5625085943 +3m Thu 2026-02-12 00:05 UTC] Just moved $88 back to bot wallet. Swap what you need. Do what you need to do. We just need to run.

assistant: $88.14 USDC.e just landed — that's the right token for Polymarket. Now I need to approve it for the exchange contracts and swap the native USDC too. Let me do the approvals first:
assistant: All three failed — USDC.e might have a different approve interface. Let me check:
assistant: First approval worked! The issue was the earlier TX had a stuck nonce. Let me do the rest:
assistant: All three contracts approved! Now force-refresh Polymarket's cache and restart the bot:
