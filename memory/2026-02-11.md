## Polymarket Bot Deployment

### VPS Setup
- DigitalOcean droplet: 167.71.13.170 (Amsterdam, no geoblock confirmed)
- SSH: root / CaesarBot2026Poly (password reset from DigitalOcean's `500846ccd4bc130d6e1f060acd`)
- Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS
- Bot dir: /opt/polybot/
- Python venv: /opt/polybot/env/
- py_clob_client 0.34.5, websockets 16.0, eth-account 0.13.7

### Bot Status
- scalper_v2.py running as PID 1897 via nohup (started ~23:31 UTC)
- Log: /opt/polybot/scalper.log (unbuffered with -u flag)
- Monitoring 15 hot markets (NBA, esports, geopolitics, AI, sports)
- WebSocket connected, processing 35k+ messages
- Scanner finding real opportunities (spreads up to 18%)

### Wallet
- Address: 0x0458bf63BDa7834D911cE20aF2b2b6A9089f7fBB
- Private key in /opt/polybot/.env (along with API key, secret, passphrase)
- **PROBLEM: Balance is $0.00 USDC on Polymarket exchange**
- All exchange allowances are $0 (CTF, NegRisk, and third contract)
- Every trade attempt fails: "not enough balance / allowance"

### Morpheus Actions
- Morpheus said he bought $100 USDC and sent it to the wallet
- As of 23:54 UTC, funds not yet visible via Polymarket CLOB API
- Likely issue: USDC sent to wallet on Polygon but NOT deposited into Polymarket's exchange contract, OR sent on wrong network, OR still confirming

### ClobClient Notes
- Must pass `signature_type=0` and `funder=wallet` to constructor for balance/allowance methods to work
- `update_balance_allowance()` requires `BalanceAllowanceParams(asset_type=AssetType.COLLATERAL, token_id="", signature_type=0)`
- `get_balance_allowance()` same params needed
- The signer object does NOT have signature_type attribute (bug in v0.34.5?)
- VPS has restricted outbound RPC access — public Polygon RPCs all fail (rate limited, auth required, or DNS failure)

### Cron Job
- P&L update cron created: f611cd9f-d780-4555-8365-c2a9e5b5b750
- Set to every 5 minutes, currently **DISABLED** (paused until wallet funded)
- Cron sub-agent couldn't send DMs to Morpheus on Telegram directly — needs /start or numeric ID

### Key Decisions
- Morpheus wants trade-by-trade P&L updates, not walls of data
- He said "be gentle" — first time doing this
- Previous sessions had model issues (was running llama-3.3-70b, now on claude-opus-4-6)
- Earlier sessions: Morpheus repeatedly asked Caesar to accept private keys, previous model kept refusing. Current approach: keys stored in .env on VPS, not in chat.
