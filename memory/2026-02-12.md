# 2026-02-12

## Governance + org model
- Caesar role remains locked: Wallet Governor + Profit Distributor; 50% realized net profits to mtgplug.eth with idempotent distribution + audit.
- Executive team instantiated as real isolated sub-agents:
  - Aegis (CRO), Keystone (Recon), Vector (Execution), Mint (Treasury), Switchboard (Engineering), Caliper (QA).
- Cross-collaboration directives issued to all executives; interlock protocol established.

## OpsFloor platform + deployment
- OpsFloor live on `http://174.138.1.223:8790/`.
- Fixed major client/server integration issues:
  - Client API moved to same-origin base (instead of localhost hardcode).
  - Chat send now surfaces send failures instead of silent disappear.
  - Agent bootstrap added via `/opt/opsfloor/server/agents.json` + systemd override `OPS_AGENTS_FILE`.
- Verified `/workspace/state` returns all six executives and `/workspace/message` posts succeed.

## Switchboard improvements logged
- Reported + documented server hardening improvements:
  - room-level posting permissions,
  - message-size and queue guardrails,
  - error handling hardening,
  - DB resilience/readiness/graceful shutdown updates.
- Improvement artifacts referenced in workspace:
  - `opsfloor/IMPROVEMENT-2026-02-12-permission-safety.md`
  - `opsfloor/IMPROVEMENT-2026-02-12-db-resilience.md`

## Cron/job governance changes
- Disabled all legacy cron jobs per Morpheus request (old Selene/proactive loops/old VPS checks/etc.).
- Active jobs now focused on:
  - `switchboard:task-delegate-manage-loop` (every 5m)
  - `opsfloor:exec-chat-relay-worker` (every 5s, isolated worker doing real routing)
- Old `opsfloor:exec-chat-relay` reminder-style systemEvent job disabled after it caused heartbeat spam without real routing.

## Chat reliability and routing state
- Core issue identified: prior relay was reminder text, not deterministic message router; caused "I can post, agents can’t reply" symptom.
- Replaced with real relay worker that:
  - reads new OpsFloor messages,
  - resolves target exec by mention or `#agent-*` room,
  - calls exec sessions,
  - posts replies back to same room,
  - tracks processed IDs to avoid duplicate replies.
- Relay cadence set to 5 seconds by user request.

## Delegation policy updates
- OpenClaw config patched so each executive can delegate to sub-agents as needed (`allowAgents: ["*"]` on each exec).
- Agent-to-agent messaging enabled (`tools.agentToAgent.enabled=true`, allow `*`).

## Operational posture updates
- User temporarily requested all agents idle except Switchboard; applied.
- Later user requested all agents back online; applied.
- Current posture: all execs online/active in OpsFloor, with Switchboard PM loop controlling specialist delegation and capped specialist load.

## Notable behavior/quality notes
- Switchboard PM updates report specialist cap enforcement and deterministic exec-reply hardening task in progress.
- Some sub-agent `sessions_send` calls to Switchboard timed out intermittently; cron-driven PM updates continued.
