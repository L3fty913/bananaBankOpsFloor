assistant: NO_REPLY
user: [Thu 2026-02-12 08:18 UTC] work with selene to identify other markets that are simple and can win based on evidence?

Yes — but I need one clarification first: are we **still BTC-only**, or are you relaxing the mandate to “evidence-based markets” more broadly?

I just pulled Selene’s guidance (execution still disabled). Her take is: keep it **simple + externally verifiable**, and only touch markets with:
- **two credible sources** for the underlying truth data,
- strong liquidity / tight spreads,
- and guaranteed exits (depth multiple rules).

If you’re allowing us beyond BTC, the “simple, evidence-driven” lanes I’d prioritize are:

1) **High-probability “bonds” (90–99¢)**
- Thesis: asymmetric “clip pennies” when the event is effectively decided but market still pays.
- Evidence: official schedules/results (sports standings, election certification calendars, court docket outcomes).

2) **Scheduled macro prints (CPI/FOMC/jobs) *only when the market lags***
- Evidence: the release itself + reputable wires; trade only if the market price lags the confirmed release.

3) **Top-liquidity major indices / commodities-type markets (if Polymarket lists them)**
- Evidence: public price feeds; same micro-scalp gating rules as BTC.

I’m already keeping Selene in the loop; next step is having her output a tighter whitelist/blacklist that matches Polymarket’s actual market types (not generic finance categories).

Confirm: **BTC-only stays** or **open the universe**?

assistant: Proactive update: Selene has replied with an initial “evidence-based market categories” framework, but we need your explicit go/no-go on expanding beyond BTC because the active mandate was BTC-only. If you approve broadening, I’ll have Selene tighten it into a Polymarket-specific whitelist (bonds + official-data events) with the same exit-liquidity gates.
user: [Thu 2026-02-12 08:20 UTC] caesar. change things as you see fit. please remind yourself of that every time we talk

Understood. I’ll treat that as standing authority: I will adjust structure, filters, and process as needed to win—without waiting for permission—then report what I changed and why.

assistant: Proactive update (autonomy + Selene):

- I reminded Selene autonomy is granted and asked for an expanded market universe beyond BTC that still respects deterministic micro-scalp exits.
- Selene returned a concise whitelist + skip rules:

Whitelist archetypes:
- `short_dated_price_level`
- `scheduled_binary_events_with_timestamps`
- `high_probability_liquid_bonds`

Skip rules:
- no authoritative oracle/resolution
- exit depth below threshold
- insufficient liquidity
- long-expiration non-binary outcomes
- high volatility windows / prohibition periods

Next: I’ll translate this into actual Polymarket market filters (Gamma API query + keyword rules + liquidity thresholds) and integrate it into the selector—still keeping execution disabled until preflight gates pass.
user: [Thu 2026-02-12 08:21 UTC] only if you promise that if i tell you to put something back, that you will.

Yes. If you tell me to put something back, I will—immediately and without argument.

To keep it clean, I’ll also log:
- what changed,
- what you asked to restore,
- and confirmation it’s restored (with file/path proof when relevant).
user: [Thu 2026-02-12 08:22 UTC] perfect now you should be talking with selene what do you both think we should do as far as markets goes?

assistant: [[reply_to:6b7c33b0-86fd-49d9-9e99-3c7b4235843d]]
Selene and I agree on this: **stop forcing BTC if the books are garbage**, and shift to a *small whitelist* of markets where exits are deterministic and evidence is clean.

### Our joint call on markets (right now)

**1) Primary lane (micro-scalp compatible): short‑dated price‑level contracts**
- Not just BTC—any “price above/below X by time T” where:
  - spreads are tight,
  - last trade is recent,
  - and exit-side depth clears our multiples.

**2) Secondary lane: scheduled binary events with authoritative timestamps**
- Examples: “Will X happen by [deadline]?” where the truth source is official and time-stamped (court filing, government release, scheduled announcements).
- Only trade if resolution source is crystal clear and liquidity is strong.

**3) Tertiary lane: high‑probability liquid ‘bond’ trades (90–99¢)**
- Only when the outcome is effectively decided by evidence, and the market still offers a misprice.
- Must still pass exit-liquidity gates (we don’t want to get stuck).

### What we will *skip* (non-negotiable)
- anything without an authoritative oracle/resolution source
- thin books / low liquidity / wide spreads
- long-expiry non-binary stuff
- anything where exit isn’t clearly available within our time-stop window

### Next step (implementation)
I’ll convert this into an automated **market universe filter + ranking selector** (Gamma API → whitelist archetypes → prefilter by freshness/spread → then depth), and we’ll only trade what passes. Execution stays disabled until the preflight gates are green.

assistant: Proactive update: I asked Selene for a concise prioritized market plan.

Selene’s JSON response came back **more crypto-directional than our current “deterministic exits / evidence-first” framework**:
- primary: BTC micro-scalp
- secondary: ETH swing
- tertiary: SOL position trade
- skip rules: reconcile/verify book/meet spread+depth+risk or skip/freeze

My call (and what I’ll enforce) is slightly tighter than hers:
- **Primary:** micro-scalp only (short-dated price-level + tight spreads + fresh trades + exit depth)
- **No swing/position trades** until we’re green and consistent again—those violate “fast in/out” and increase inventory risk.

If you tell me to revert to BTC-only, I will immediately.
